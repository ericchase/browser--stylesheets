# stylesheets
Style-sheets for use with the Stylish extension to modify the styles of existing webpages.

### usage
To use these, please install a css-injection extension for your browser.<br/>
Any lines with **@-moz-document** contains information for the *Stylish* extension.<br/>
They are used for easy importing, and are not part of the CSS.<br/>
If using a different extension, remove those lines first.<br/>
For extra clarity, I will surround the actual CSS code with comments.

### extension
The Stylish extension for Google Chrome can be found here: [Stylish - Custom themes for any website](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog)

### please
Use these stylesheets and feel free to share them.<br/>
If improvements can be made, submit an issue!<br/>
Thanks<br/>
